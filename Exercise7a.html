        <h3 id="Paprika">Paprika 2006 Movie</h3>
        <img src="Paprika.jpg">
        <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><b>Sypnosis:</b><br>Dr. Atsuko Chiba works as a scientist by day and, under the code name "Paprika," is a dream detective at night. 
            Atsuko and her colleagues are working on a device called the DC Mini, which is intended to help psychiatric patients, 
            but in the wrong hands it could destroy people's minds. When a prototype is stolen, Atsuko/Paprika springs into action to 
            recover it before damage is done.</p>

        <h3 id="Silent">Silent Hill 2006 Movie</h3>
        <img src="SilentHill.jpg">
        <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><b>Sypnosis:</b><br>Rose Da Silva and her husband Christopher are deeply disturbed by their adopted daughter Sharon's constant sleepwalking 
            and nightmares about Silent Hill, a town in West Virginia that was abandoned 30 years ago due to a massive coal seam fire.
             Against Christopher's wishes, Rose takes Sharon on a trip to Silent Hill to find answers. Her erratic behaviour concerns police 
             officer, Cybil Bennett. Rose flees from Cybil, but when a girl steps out into the road, Rose crashes and blacks out. 
             Waking up some time later, Rose finds herself in the foggy dimension of Silent Hill and realizes that Sharon is missing.</p>

        <h3 id="Hill">Silent Hill: Revelation 2012 Movie</h3>
        <img src="Revelation.jpg">
        <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><b>Sypnosis:</b><br>In January 2011, Sharon Da Silva and her adoptive father Christopher, have spent the past few years moving from town
             to town and assuming different identities, including the names Heather Mason and Harry Mason. Heather believes that they are on 
             the run from the police because Harry killed a man in self-defense and that her adoptive mother Rose Da Silva
              died in a car crash. In fact, he has been protecting her from the Order, a cult of Silent Hill. Rose was able to free Heather 
              from the fog world using one half of a talisman called the Seal of Metatron, but she remained trapped in Silent Hill.</p>

        <h3 id="it">It 2017 Movie</h3>
        <img src="It.jpg">
        <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><b>Sypnosis:</b><br>Seven young outcasts in Derry, Maine, are about to face their worst nightmare -- an ancient, shape-shifting evil that 
            emerges from the sewer every 27 years to prey on the town's children. Banding together over the course of one horrifying summer, 
            the friends must overcome their own personal fears to battle the murderous, bloodthirsty clown known as Pennywise.</p>

        <h3 id="eerie">Eerie 2018 Film</h3>
        <img src="Eerie.jpg">
        <p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;"><b>Sypnosis:</b><br>The unexpected and gruesome death of a student threatens the existence of an old Catholic school for girls. 
            Pat Consolacion is the school guidance counsellor who involves herself with the students to help them cope. She also helps uncover
             the mysteries of the student's death. Most students suspect it is the strict and borderline abusive Mother Alice. This is because 
             she also threatened Pat's tenure in the school because of her continuous meddling with the case. But Pat's unusual talents lead her
              to know Eri, a former student who has been watching the whole school for years. Pat uncovers the secret of the school and the monster 
              that it nurtured for the past century.</p>
