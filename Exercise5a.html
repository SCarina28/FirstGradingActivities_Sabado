        <h6 style="text-align: center;">By: Kishore Jethanandani Published: November 20, 2019</h6>
        <p>In an age of global cloud and software-defined hyperscale networks, together with big data, automated and distributed digital enterprise 
            built on top of the Internet of Things (IoT), operation managers struggle to put their heads around the interdependent dynamics of these 
            labyrinths in 2D.</p>
        <p>They crave a heuristic view of intersecting systems, which helps them to see relationships in the data, root causes of problems, the 
            decision trade-offs, and the impact of remedies for their problems.</p>
        <p>What they don't want is to have their view obscured by an impenetrable fog of amorphous data, plus they want to control live 
            operations to streamline them.</p>
        <p>Currently, IT decision-makers make-do with textual reports, interspersed with rudimentary charts and graphs drawn with spreadsheets, 
            to gain situational awareness of their operations and to weigh decision options for optimization.</p>
    <h3>Beyond Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is meant to comb through reams of data and provide pointers to solutions. In most cases, algorithms are
             black boxes that crunch data and derive coefficients of mathematical functions for quantifying the impacts of performance variables, 
             which is not intuitive in the ambiguous world of decision-makers who need to see visuals of live reality to gain insights.</p>
        <p>Interactive 3D graphical display of information addresses the need for presentation of critical parameters of performance, sifted 
            from a mass of data with help from machine learning (ML), for decision-makers to explore, simulate and predict, on a single virtual
             interface, to arrive at conclusions.</p>
        <p>Mixed reality, in combination with virtual reality and augmented reality, and interactive natural user interaction like hand gestures 
            afford the flexibility for users to view the data from multiple angles to help them assimilate the information quickly.</p>
        <p>Existing studies have confirmed that task performance effectiveness rises by more than 50% with a 3D stereoscopic view of data that
             enhances perceptions of spatial dimensions. Gesture interaction aids fluidity of manipulation of the images to be able to probe 
             from multiple directions.</p>
        <p>Wearable devices support rapid interplay with graphics as they have more degrees of freedom to view images from several vantage 
            points. The graphics are also vivid due to the proximity of wearables.</p>
        <p>However, users of wearable devices continue to experience a blur as their field of view changes, which is detrimental to task performance.</p>
